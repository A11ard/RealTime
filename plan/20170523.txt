THIS IS THE LATEST ORDER OF BUSINESS: 

1. Jeffrey: 

2. Leo: 

3. Allard: make the Stack, the data structure of the graveyard in the game 


DISCUSSED IMPLEMENTATIONS/UPDATES:

- The means of targeting is no longer done by a Priority Queue. A linear search through the ArrayList of enemy units (a search for
the unit with the shortest distance) shall be used instead. This is more efficient than putting all units in a PQ and then
returning the first one. 

- It has been determined that the Wizard will use a lightning strike. The closest 4 enemy units will be struck. This will be done
using a PQ. 

- The field will be viewed not from the side, as in an elevation, nor from top-down, as in a bird's eye view. Rather, it'll be
viewed from a 45 degree angle with the plane of the field.

- The measure for determining proximity will be through the distance formula, sqrt(x^2 + y^2), with x and y being the x and y
coords on the cartesian plane of Processing's interface.
