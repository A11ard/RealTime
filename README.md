## Revolution Geometry

### Project
A RTS lane defense game, with two opposing sides looking to destroy the opposing nexus. An assortment of magic abilities, troops, and weapons are used to further along a line of defense. This game is similar to games like Stick Wars, Epic War 4, and Age of War 2. 

* You will initially control a freely moving **“Commander”** character, and be able to summon troops to aid you in your fight. 
* There will be a Mana counter that is stored and will be used as a currency system to enable you to deploy troops. 
* Troops will be found in a menu type of bar on the bottom with a deck of cards. 
  * You’ll be dealt randomly a set of Utility cards(3) that can be used during battle which can either heal up your nexus, or help you progress farther down the lane. 
  * You’ll also have the units that you can use on the bottom menu that will spawn the units on to the field, that also have to be ready for deployment. 
    * There are also specific utility troops that can help you generate more currency and help defense. 
 
**Win Condition:** Nexus of other player is destroyed OR the computer’s Commander Unit is destroyed </br>
**Lose Condition:** Your nexus is destroyed OR Commander unit is destroyed.

The entire game will be built in Processing.
